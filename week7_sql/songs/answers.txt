- Average Energy: 0.659 (moderately high energy)
- Average Valence: 0.484 (slightly below neutral, leaning melancholic)
- Average Danceability: 0.716 (high danceability)

This listener appears to enjoy moderately energetic, highly danceable music with a slightly melancholic or bittersweet emotional tone. Their musical taste suggests someone who likes upbeat, rhythmic songs that are good for dancing, but with emotional depth rather than purely happy vibes.

Why this calculation might not be representative:

1. This method assumes all 100 songs were listened to equally, but in reality, some songs are played much more frequently than others. A song played 200 times should have more influence on the aura than one played 10 times.

2. The calculation doesn't account for when during the year songs were played. Recent listening habits might be more representative of current mood than songs from January.

3. Songs played during workouts, parties, or relaxation might serve different purposes and reflect different aspects of personality.

4. A few songs with extreme values could skew the averages, not accurately representing the listener's general preferences.

Better ways to calculate audio aura:

1. Weight each song by play count, so frequently played songs have more influence on the aura calculation.

2. Give more weight to recently played songs, as they may better represent current musical preferences.

3. Group songs by audio features and identify the most prominent clusters, rather than simple averages.

4. Consider different listening contexts (workout playlists, sleep music, etc.) and calculate separate auras or weighted combinations.

5. Use medians instead of means to reduce the impact of outliers.

6. Focus more heavily on the top 20-30 most played songs rather than treating all 100 equally.
