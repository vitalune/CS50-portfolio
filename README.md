# CS50-portfolio

## Introduction

Hi, I'm an 18 year old high school senior from Arlington, Virginia, captivated by the transformative power that computer science and AI plays onto the world. Even though AI is extraordinary at this very moment, it is still in a very premature stage. For that reason, I'm accelerating my learning to claim my slice of the future.

## About CS50

CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to computer science- a course renowned for its rigorous problem sets, engaging lectures, and real-world applications. Although I have taken other introductory CS courses at my high school, CS50 pushes me to deepen my understanding of programming concepts and problem-solving techniques. It covers fundamental topics like algorithms, data structures, and memory management in languages such as C and Python, offering a broader and more challenging perspective that has significantly enhanced my programming skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to showcase my CS50 projects, arranged by week. Each weekly folder contains the assignments and projects completed during that time. For example:

```

## Projects

### Week 1: Mario-More

This project uses for-loops to create two mirrored staircase shapes. The size of the stairs is dynamically generated based on the user’s input, reinforcing concepts of iteration and control flow.

### Week 2 Projects

* Caesar:
A program implementing the Caesar cipher, which allows the user to shift their text by a desired number of letters. This project introduces basic encryption and string manipulation.

* Scrabble:
An imitation of the Scrabble board game. It assigns specific point values to each letter of the alphabet, then compares two input strings to determine which one yields a higher total score.
* Readability:
This program calculates a reading-level score for a given text to estimate the corresponding grade level. It is an effective tool for assessing readability, though it does not factor in word complexity. I plan to enhance this project in the future.
* Substitution:
An encryption tool that accepts a 26-letter key (representing a permutation of the English alphabet). It then substitutes each letter in the user’s text with the corresponding letter from the key, demonstrating more advanced cipher techniques.
